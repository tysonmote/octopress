[iTunes Match][icloud] is a great service. It "just works" between my Mac, iPhone, and iPad. It let me re-download high quality versions of thousands of poorly-encoded MP3s. It lets me listen to my entire library whenever and wherever I want. It was well worth the price, especially considering how direly my library was in need of rehabilitation.

Of course, that doesn't preclude me from nitpicking and complaining about it. Thus:

* It will frequently match your "explicit" songs with their "clean" versions, turning your prized rap collection into an episode of Yo Gabba Gabba. Thankfully, my George Carlin MP3s escaped this mangling. (Can you even *imagine*?)
* It will refuse to match or upload songs encoded below 96kbps. Ostensibly, this is to ensure the accuracy of the audio fingerprinting. This doesn't make sense to me for two reasons: One, why not let me upload my low-bitrate songs? Two, I [upconverted my MP3s][bitrate_forcer] and iTunes Match had no real problem matching my 5,000 songs with great accuracy.
* It provides no methods to replace your ID3 tags with correct ones in cases where your tags are incorrect / incomplete.

*List will be updated as needed.*
