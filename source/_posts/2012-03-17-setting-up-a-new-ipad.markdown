I bought the new iPad yesterday, and this was my entire setup process migrating from my old iPad:

1. Unbox and turn on new iPad.
2. Enter some preliminary settings (language, wi-fi, etc.) and my iCloud username and password.
3. Come back in an hour or so.
4. Re-enter a few email / other account passwords (which iCloud doesn't store).

And that was it. If it wasn't for the new screen, I wouldn't be able to tell you which iPad was which.

The setup process for my *running watch* requires more steps than that.
